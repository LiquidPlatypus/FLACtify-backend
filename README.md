- collect feedback through issues
- accept improvements via pull requests

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions are **welcome** in the following forms:
- opening issues (bug reports, feature suggestions)
- well-scoped and justified pull requests

By submitting a pull request, you agree that:
- your contribution becomes part of the project
- it may be modified, accepted, or rejected at the maintainer’s discretion
- it is licensed under the same terms as the project itself

## 🚫 What is not allowed

Unless explicit permission is granted:
- redistributing the project or any modified version
- publishing a public fork
- using the code in another project
- any commercial use

## 📄 License

This project is distributed under a **proprietary license**.  
See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for full details.

## ❓ Why not open source?

This project is not open source by design.

While the source code is publicly available to encourage transparency and
collaboration, the project owner wants to:
- maintain full control over the project’s direction and distribution
- prevent the creation of competing or redistributed versions
- ensure a single, coherent vision for the project

Opening the code to contributions (issues and pull requests) allows the
community to help improve the project without fragmenting it into multiple
forks or unofficial releases.

This approach helps keep the project focused, consistent, and maintainable
while still benefiting from external feedback and contributions.
